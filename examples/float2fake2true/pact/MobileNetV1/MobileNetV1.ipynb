    "A fundamental functionality of PyTorch is its convenient interface for using GPUs.\n",
    "Before we explain how this interface works, we need to provide some additional information about the workings of PyTorch `Tensor`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each PyTorch `Tensor` is a wrapper abstraction around a *payload* array.\n",
    "Apart from this payload, a `Tensor` has other attributes and methods, most of which operate on the payload (we call these *payload methods*).\n",
    "One of these attributes is `device`, which indicates whether the payload is stored on the main memory of the computing system (i.e., the one managed directly by the CPU) or on the memory of some accelerator attached to the computing system (e.g., a GPU). The C++ backend of `Tensor`s includes several implementations of payload methods, one for each computing device that might be available on our computing system (e.g., CPU vs. GPU).\n",
    "Depending on the `device` attributes of the `Tensor`s involved in a given operation, PyTorch's runtime engine dispatches the code to the correct version of the payload method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most `Module`s have parameters or hyper-parameters, but moving them individually and manually to the correct device memory can become cumbersome and is error-prone.\n",
    "Thus, PyTorch `Module`s expose a `to` method which can be used to automatically move all the parameters and hyper-parameters to the correct device memory.\n",
    "Due to the hierarchical nature of `Module` compositions, calling `to` on a container `Module` will invoke the same call on its children `Module`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "If more than one GPU is available on our system, it is possible to wrap a `Module` into an `nn.DataParallel` object.\n",
    "At runtime, this object will automatically replicate the `Module` and map a replica to each available GPU; then, it will partition mini-batches to distribute data points evenly amongst all the available GPUs.\n",
    "`DataParallel` objects are a convenient abstraction to exploit all the computational power available on your computing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that QuantLib's editing functionalities only work on `Module`s.\n",
    "Since `DataParallel` objects are wrappers around `Module`s but not `Module` objects, we prefer to keep at least one symbolic handle to the main `Module` object.\n",
