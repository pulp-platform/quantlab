    "A fundamental functionality of PyTorch is its convenient interface to use GPUs.\n",
    "Before we explain how this interface works, we need to recap how PyTorch `Tensor`s work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each PyTorch `Tensor` is a wrapper structure around a *payload* array.\n",
    "Apart from this payload, a `Tensor` has other attributes and methods, most of which operate on the payload (we call these *payload methods*).\n",
    "One of these attributes is `device`, which indicates whether the payload is stored on the main memory of the computing system (i.e., the one managed directly by the CPU) or on the memory of some GPU attached to the computing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C++ backend of `Tensor`s includes several implementations of payload methods, one for each computing device (CPU vs. GPU) that might be available on our computing system.\n",
    "At runtime, depending on the `device` attributes of the `Tensor`s involved in a given operation, PyTorch's engine dispatches the code to the correct version of the payload method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most `Module`s have parameters or hyper-parameters, but moving them individually and manually to the correct device memory can become cumbersome.\n",
    "Thus, PyTorch `Module`s expose a `to` method which, if passed the `device` argument, automatically moves all the parameters and hyper-parameters to the correct device memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If more than one GPU is available on our system, it is possible to wrap a `Module` into an `nn.DataParallel` object, which will automatically map model replicas to all the GPUs and partition mini-batches to exploit all the available computational power.\n",
    "However, we note that most of QuantLib's editing functionalities only work on `Module`s.\n",
